# Fall2020-Assignment1-Ray-Tracing
How to run the Program: 
Run the main.cpp or makefile. Once it runs, wait 30 to 60 minutes for it to finish. 
Two png files will be made. part 2.png is the PerspectiveProjection.png projection and OrthoProjection.png is the orthographic projection. 
If you cannot find the file, type the file name in the search bar and you will find it.


What doesn't work: I was not able to get 1.3 to 1.6 to work. I attempted to do it but I could not figure it out before the due date.  I am not 100% sure if shadows work.
I do think it does.

Concern issues: 
For some reason, When I use , only one sphere appears but when I use orthographic projection, three appears.
The program at most takes a minute to run.
In the code, there was an attempt to add a plane and mesh but I was not able to get it to work. 
I did not comment plane because it did not cause any crashes. Meshes did so I had to comment it.
I was not able to create a plane so I am not 100% if the shadow feature does not work. 
Most likely it doesn't.



Future Plans:
When doing some research, there is a series of books on raytracing that I would like to use and learn on my spare time so I can get better with it.
